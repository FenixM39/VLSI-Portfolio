# Physical Design of a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using Open-Source EDA Tools

This repository documents the complete RTL-to-GDSII physical design flow for a 16-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU). The project was executed using a fully open-source toolchain and the SkyWater 130nm Process Design Kit (PDK).

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate a practical understanding of the entire Application-Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) back-end design process, from a hardware description language to a final, manufacturable layout.

## Key Features
- **Design:** A 16-bit ALU capable of performing arithmetic (ADD, SUB) and logical (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) operations.
- **Technology Node:** SkyWater 130nm (SKY130).
- **Flow:** Fully automated RTL-to-GDSII flow using OpenLANE.
- **Verification:** The final layout is clean of Design Rule Check (DRC) violations and passes the Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) check.

## The Open-Source RTL-to-GDSII Flow

The project was implemented using the OpenLANE automated flow, which integrates several open-source tools to perform the complete physical design process. The major stages are:

1.  **Synthesis:** Converts the Verilog RTL code into a gate-level netlist using Yosys.
2.  **Floorplanning:** Defines the core area of the chip, places I/O pins, and creates the power delivery network (PDN).
3.  **Placement:** Places the standard cells from the netlist onto the floorplan rows.
4.  **Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS):** Builds a balanced clock tree to distribute the clock signal to all sequential elements with minimal skew.
5.  **Routing:** Connects the placed cells using multiple metal layers.
6.  **Signoff:** Performs final checks, including DRC, LVS, and Static Timing Analysis (STA) to ensure the design is correct and meets performance targets.

## Tools Used

-   **OpenLANE:** An automated RTL to GDSII flow that integrates the following tools.
-   **Yosys:** For Verilog synthesis.
-   **OpenROAD:** For floorplanning, placement, CTS, and routing.
-   **Magic:** For viewing and editing the final layout.
-   **KLayout:** For viewing the final GDSII layout.
-   **Netgen:** For Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) verification.

## How to Run

To replicate the results, you will need to have Docker and OpenLANE installed.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    cd <your-repo-folder>
    ```

2.  **Launch the OpenLANE flow:**
    From within the OpenLANE Docker environment, run the following command:
    ```bash
    ./flow.tcl -design .
    ```
    The `config.json` file in this directory will be used to configure the flow.

3.  **View the final layout:**
    The final GDSII file will be located at:
    `runs/RUN_<date>/results/signoff/alu.gds`
    You can open this file using KLayout or Magic.

## Final Layout

Here is a screenshot of the final routed layout for the 16-bit ALU as viewed in KLayout.

*(**Action for you:** Replace this text with a screenshot of your final GDSII from KLayout. This is the most important visual for your project!)*

## Results Summary

The flow completed successfully, meeting the initial design targets. The final metrics for the ALU are summarized below:

| Parameter                 | Value                  |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Technology Node           | 130nm                  |
| Die Area                  | 120 µm x 120 µm        |
| Standard Cell Count       | ~1,200                 |
| Max Frequency             | 55 MHz                 |
| Worst Negative Slack (WNS)| +0.85 ns               |
| **DRC Violations** | **0** |
| **LVS Clean** | **Yes** |

*(**Action for you:** Update the values in this table with the actual results from your final run reports located in `runs/RUN_<date>/reports/`)*

## Future Work

-   Optimize the design for lower power consumption by implementing clock gating.
-   Explore different floorplanning strategies to further improve the area and timing.
-   Synthesize and implement the design using a different standard cell library to compare performance.
